# üîê Google Maps API Security Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY MEASURES

Your API key is now configured, but please follow these security steps immediately:

### 1. Restrict Your API Key (CRITICAL)
Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and:

#### Application Restrictions:
- Select "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
- Add these referrers:
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/*
  https://yourdomain.com/*
  https://*.yourdomain.com/*
  https://*.vercel.app/*  (if using Vercel)
  ```

#### API Restrictions:
- Select "Restrict key"
- Enable only these APIs:
  - Maps JavaScript API
  - Places API (if using search features)
  - Geocoding API (if converting addresses)

### 2. Monitor Usage
- Set up billing alerts in Google Cloud Console
- Monitor daily usage quotas
- Set usage limits to prevent unexpected charges

### 3. Environment Security
- ‚úÖ Your `.env.local` is already in `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Never commit API keys to version control
- ‚úÖ Use different keys for development/production

### 4. Additional APIs You Might Need

For a complete fleet management system, consider enabling:
- **Places API**: For location search and autocomplete
- **Directions API**: For route planning
- **Distance Matrix API**: For calculating travel times
- **Geocoding API**: For address conversion
- **Roads API**: For road snapping (premium feature)

### 5. Production Deployment
When deploying to production:
- Use environment variables in your hosting platform
- Update API key restrictions with production domain
- Consider using a separate API key for production

### 6. Cost Management
- Maps JavaScript API: $7 per 1000 loads
- Places API: $17 per 1000 requests
- Set billing alerts and quotas to control costs

## Current Configuration Status
