## Next Steps (IMPORTANT) ⚠️

### 1. Secure Your API Key (Do This Now!)
Go to [Google Cloud Console > Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials):

1. **Click on your API key**
2. **Set Application Restrictions:**
   - Select "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
   - Add: `http://localhost:3000/*`
   - Add: `https://yourdomain.com/*` (replace with your actual domain)

3. **Set API Restrictions:**
   - Select "Restrict key"
   - Check: "Maps JavaScript API"
   - Check: "Places API" (recommended for search features)

### 2. Monitor Usage & Set Quotas
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console > APIs & Services > Quotas](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/maps-backend.googleapis.com/quotas)
2. Set daily quotas to prevent unexpected charges
3. Set up billing alerts

### 3. Test Your Integration
1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to Dashboard
3. Check if the map loads with vehicle markers
4. Test search functionality

### 4. Additional APIs (Optional but Recommended)
Consider enabling these for enhanced functionality:
- **Places API**: For location search and autocomplete
- **Directions API**: For route planning between vehicles
- **Geocoding API**: For address-to-coordinates conversion

### 5. Production Deployment
When deploying:
1. Copy `.env.production.example` to `.env.production.local`
2. Use a separate API key for production
3. Update API key restrictions with production domain
4. Test all map features in production environment

## Cost Estimates 💰
- Maps JavaScript API: $7 per 1,000 map loads
- Places API: $17 per 1,000 requests
- Free tier: $200/month credit (28,000+ map loads)
